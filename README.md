This project demonstrates an FAQ chatbot built using Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI.
The chatbot is designed to provide clear, consistent, and professional responses to frequently asked questions while strictly avoiding hallucinations.

The solution uses predefined FAQ content stored in Azure Blob Storage and enforces strong guardrails through a system prompt to ensure reliable and predictable behavior.
